1. This command will remove any files that matches the string, as it uses an * instead of the filename. Also with this method, not all OS will confirm the removal, such as Linux OS. [no argument behind the cd command, assumes the home directory]
2. Compiling reads the code from a file and generate an object file [turning source code into machine code] . Linking takes the created object files, links them together into an executable “file.”
3. No, as both variables are of different data type. You can’t assign a double to an int. [Yes it can. Java can't compile it as explained before, but C++ allows any type of implicit casting]
4. The sum variable isn’t initialized. I would set it equal to 0
5. The comparison is using 1 equal sign, instead of the standard 2 equal signs for a boolean comparison
