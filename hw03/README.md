1. Just memory addresses. A variable. This is because a variable equals the memory address of data. For example if you have a variable "double num = 21" then the memory address will equal "0x2468" and the data stored there will be "21"

9a. creating a pointer to int (pointer is named "a" in this sense)
9b. since there's no "*' its just a int constant named "b"
9c. pointer to the constant int (int value can't be changed)
9d. pointer to the constant pointer (pointer can't be changed)
9e. constant pointer to a constant int

12. For the function, there's no need for the star in the function name "double* powers." The "&x2" will return the new value

14. For starters "n" in "i<n" wasn't defined anywhere or passed to the function so therefor it won't build and crash

15. The code "scanf" is for java programming language. For c++ it should be "fscanf."
