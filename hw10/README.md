1. A template is like a "template" for a class. It's code is wrote out specifying the class but allows you to pass data types as arguments

2. Java has a universal base class, the Object class.

3. The template doesn't specify data types, but a class does. Template in return, will take in the data type as an argument.

7. In Java it means what the object will be cast to. No matter what you put inside, it will always be an object. Once you include something inside the object will be casted to that. Or you can exclude it since it's optional. In C++, it means a new class is being created and is written to take contain whatever data type you inserted.

8. Because there's no way to initialize them when they're created.
